    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This traditional Nigerian dish brings out the best possible flavor of rice and chicken.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Parboiled rice (measured to taste)</li>
        <li>2 pounds chicken drumsticks</li>
        <li>2 cubes chicken bouillon, crushed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ large onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place chicken drumsticks in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. 
            Add 1/2 onion, ginger, crushed bouillon cubes, garlic, curry powder, 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. 
            Mix well. Cook until chicken starts sticking to the bottom, about 5 minutes. 
            Pour in water, mix, cover the pot, and bring to a gentle simmer; cook for 15 minutes. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-low heat and cook 1/2 onion until soft and translucent but not browned, about 5 minutes. 
            Add tomato sauce; cook and stir until slightly thickened and infused into the oil, 5 to 7 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir reserved chicken broth, coconut milk, 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, salt, and pepper into the pot. Bring to a simmer; add rice. 
            Cook, stirring often, until rice is almost tender, 15 to 20 minutes. 
            Add frozen vegetables and continue cooking until rice is tender and creamy, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 1/2 cup of canola oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat. 
            Add plantains and fry on both sides until golden and crispy, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. 
            Drain on paper towels. Garnish jollof rice with friend plantains and serve with chicken.
